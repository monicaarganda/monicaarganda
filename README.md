##  :memo: Read About Me

:seedling: I am a Full Stack Web Developer Student with an eye for design. Currently I am an Intern with LEARN Academy, LEARN is a hands-on, intensive, bootcamp-style course designed to help pivot its student's careers and break into the tech world. With this education, I have worked on many projects to further my knowledge in both front and backend development and become a polyglot with different programming languages. I'm eager to continue my journey as a growing developer and fight blockers one day at a time.

:art: As I further my education I have come to enjoy contributing to my previous projects User Interface(UI). Being able to excersize this part of my skills and explore different features has exposed my creative niche. I am really enthusiastic about learning new technology that will reveal my hidden talents.

🗺 Outside of the tech world, I enjoy traveling to new destintions outside of the states and embracing different cultures. My hobbies range from reading, painting, and cosmetology to rock-climbing and hiking. I love new experiences and can't wait for the next.
